    "history":"I grew up in the Philippines and moved to the US when I was 19 yrs. old. I worked in the restaurant business and although it was a great way to meet interesting and different people, I went on to work as a secretary for a construction and inventory company for a few years. Following that I moved on to work for a lawfirm and a health insurance company as a paralegal/legal assistant . I enjoyed working in the legal field. It has something to do with the high-paced environment, constant challenge and beating deadlines that made it all exciting. Last year, I thought I would challenge myself again to learn computer programming. I was inspired by my biological father who went to Saudi Arabia to work for an oil company. He started as a clerk and worked his way up to Senior Programmer Analyst with little to no background in the field. Code Fellows was offering courses that would allow me to immerse myself to be just that. It also opened my eyes to how much more I have to learn and the complexity of being in this field. What is appealing to me is the ever changing state of technology, the ability to adapt and mold yourself to the technology and the thrilling innovations that surface every waking moment because of technology.",

I revel in articles related to science; from medical innovations to space and energy explorations. I love reading classic literature books. I am an advocate for human and animal rights. I like to travel, learn different customs, cultures and sample the vast variety of food cuisines. My outlook... Live each day as if it is your last."

    "likes":"I enjoy building websites using the skills I've been learning recently but enjoy most anything related to electronics or computers. I'm also a wanna-be audiophile. For a few years I spent a lot of time designing and building home audio speaker systems. In addition to some basic woodworking skills it involved setting up a testing environment with microphones and computers to measure frequency response and other performance metrics. It also required using different software applications for prototyping cabinet shape, size and acoustic properties. I even set up a little company called Alegria Audio in order to sell my creations with the names Ling, Rosa, Aria, Emma, Ruby and Tom. I received many positive comments from my customers along with positive professional reviews. In the end I decided it was a better hobby than a business but I wouldn't mind doing it again. I also enjoy traveling to new places and trying to get a feel for the history and culture of the place I'm visiting.I would love to spend an extended time in Europe."
