    "history":"I grew up in the Philippines and moved to the US when I was 19 yrs. old. I worked in the restaurant business and although it was a great way to meet interesting and different people, I went on to work as a secretary for a construction and inventory company for a few years. After which, I moved on to work for a lawfirm and health insurance company as a paralegal/legal assistant . I enjoy working in the legal field, it has something to do with the high-paced environment, constant challenge and beating time that made it all exciting. Last year, I thought I would challenge myself again to learn how to be a programmer. I was inspired by my biological father who went to Saudi Arabia to work for an oil company. He started as a clerk and worked his way-up as a Senior Programmer Analyst with little to no background in the field. Code Fellows was offering courses that would allow me to immerse myself to be just that. It also opened my eyes to how much more I have to learn and the complexity of being on this field. What is appealing to me are the ever changing state of technology, the ability to adapt and mold yourself to the technology and the thrilling innovations that surfaces every waking moment because of technology.",
