      <p>We made several visits to the Philippines between 1997 and 2010. In August 2010 we took a chance on living there permanently. Having visited much of Luzon, the Visayas and Palawan we decided it best to stay on Luzon. We rented an apartment in Quezon City (Manila) and started looking for a parcel of land. After 6 months we settled on a 1 hectare piece of farmland near Lucban, Quezon Province about 200 kilometers southeast of Manila. We drew up a floor plan, found a contractor and started building. The first stage was to set up a bamboo hut (known as 'bahay kubo') to live in while the main house was built. Second was to drill a well and bring in electricity. In the early part of the bahay kubo experience we had no water and no electricity on the property. What a relief it was when we finally had both! In September of 2011 our house was completed and we transferred from the kubo to the main house.</p>
      <p>The next two years were spent fighting back the jungle, dealing with insects, harsh weather, corrupt local politicians and an increasingly frustrating government bureaucracy. While there were many good points such as lots of delicious and inexpensive fresh food, privacy, peace and quiet and beautiful scenery it didn't outweigh the negatives, the biggest of which was boredom. In 2013 we sold our little piece of 'paradise' and returned to the US.</p>
      <p>Below are a few pictures we took in the Philippines.</p>
